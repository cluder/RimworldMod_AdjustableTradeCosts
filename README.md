# RimworldMod_AdjustableTradeCosts

Initially made for Rimworld Version: 1.1, seems to work with 1.2 also.

This mod lets you change the goodwill costs of requesting a trade caravan (default -15) or military aid (default -25) from an ally.

These values are currently hardcoded in various places. This mod is using [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) / Reflection to change those values. Thus it is likely to break in future Rimworld versions.
